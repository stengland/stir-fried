# Stir Fried
A Rails template for Noodall

## What does it do?

A cake load of stuff. Really, a victoria sponge worths of front end lovley-ness. In no particular order of importance. 

* Install SASS, Compass and Sprockets Gems
* Sets up the Beef standard options for these Gems
* **Coming Soon...** Create an .RVMC File for rvm
* **Coming Soon...** Update Git Ignore File with 
* Removes some files leftover from Noodall, Rails and Gems
* Creates Assets Folders
* Adds Beefplate 
* **Coming Soon...** Use's Bundler to install Gems 
* **Coming Soon...** Commits everything to GitHub.

## How the hell do I make it do that?

Thats really easy. Firstly you'll need a bit of Noodall love going on. Check the wiki at: https://github.com/noodall/noodall/wiki/Quick-Start

*But*, when you create the app, also use the template. Lets watch: 

```
noodall my-app -m https://raw.github.com/discoliam/stir-fried/master/template.rb
```

## Anything else I need to know?

Almost certainly, but thats all you get from me for now. Read the template, and Beefplate and you'll be able to see everything it does in detail.
